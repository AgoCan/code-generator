# Cheetah - Go Scaffold Tool

[中文简体](README.md)

## The Story of the Cheetah

The cheetah (Cheetah) is the fastest animal on Earth, capable of catching prey with its agile movements and incredible running speed. The cheetah's speed and efficiency are not only its survival advantages in the wild, but also a goal pursued by many tools and frameworks in modern technology—fast, efficient, and simple.

Just as the cheetah conquers nature with speed and agility, the design concept of the Cheetah scaffold tool is to enable developers to quickly and agilely start and build Go projects, eliminating tedious configuration and repetitive tasks, and allowing them to focus on implementing business logic.

## Project Overview

`Cheetah` is a Go language scaffold tool designed to help developers quickly build and launch common application architectures and code templates. By encapsulating and automating a series of common technology stacks and development workflows, it enables developers to start projects efficiently and reduces manual configuration and repetitive work.
